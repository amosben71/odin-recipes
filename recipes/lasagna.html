    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb Ground Beef</li>
        <li>24 oz Diced Tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 lb Carrots</li>
        <li>1 Stalk of Celery</li>
        <li>3 Medium White Onions</li>
        <li>1 Cup of Red Wine</li>
        <li>2 Large Containers of Riccota</li>
        <li>1 Bag of Mozerella</li>
        <li>1 Box of Lasagna Sheets</li>
        <li>1 Block of Parmesean with the Rind</li>
        <li>Salt, Pepper, Garlic Powder, Oregeno, Chili Flakes (To Taste)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat Oven to 375°F (190°C)</li>
        <li>Chop the onions, carrots, and celery into small pieces. 
            <br>Add them to the pot and cook until softened, about 5-7 
            <br>minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the vegetables, and in the same pot, brown the 
            <br>ground beef over medium heat until the fat has rendered 
            <br>and the pan is roaring.</li>
        <li>Add the vegetables back into the pot with the beef. Pour 
            <br>in the red wine to deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned 
            <br>bits from the bottom.</li>
        <li>Add the diced tomatoes, along with salt, pepper, garlic 
            <br>powder, oregano, and chili flakes to taste as well as the 
            <br>parmesean rind. Simmer the sauce for at least 1 hour, stirring 
            <br>occasionally.</li>
        <li>In a large baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat 
            <br>sauce on the bottom. Layer lasagna sheets over the sauce, 
            <br>followed by a layer of ricotta, a layer of mozerella, and 
            <br>then more meat sauce. Repeat these layers until all ingredients 
            <br>are used, finishing with a layer of meat sauce topped with 
            <br>mozerella and parmesean.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the 
            <br>preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake 
            <br>for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until the cheese is 
            <br>bubbly and golden brown.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna rest for about 15 minutes before serving 
            <br>to allow it to set.</li>
    </ol>
