    <h3>This recipe involves a delicious marinated chicken as well
        <br>as rice flavored with lime and bay leaves.</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb Chicken</li>
        <li>3 Cups of Rice</li>
        <li>2 Limes</li>
        <li>1 Bay Leaf</li>
        <li>2 Cups of Olive Oil</li>
        <li>5 Cloves of Garlic</li>
        <li>5 Tbsp of Chili Powder</li>
        <li>2 Tsp of Cumin</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper to Taste</li>
        <li>Optional: 1 Broccoli Crown</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat Oven to 375°F (190°C)</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine oil, chili powder, cumin, salt, and 
            <br>pepper. Squeeze the juice of one lime into the bowl and 
            <br>mix well to create a marinade.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken to the marinade, ensuring each piece is well
            <br>coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to
            <br>allow the flavors to infuse.</li>
        <li>While the chicken is marinating, rinse the rice under cold
            <br>water until the water runs clear. This helps to remove excess
            <br>starch and prevents the rice from becoming too sticky.</li>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, bring 6 cups of water to a boil. Add the
            <br>bay leaf and a pinch of salt. Stir in the rice, reduce the heat
            <br>to low, cover, and simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until the rice
            <br>is tender and the water is absorbed. Remove from heat and let it sit, 
            <br>covered, for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork.</li>
        <li>While the rice is cooking, place the marinated chicken on a baking
            <br>sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake in the preheated oven for
            <br>25-30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and has an
            <br>internal temperature of 165°F (74°C). If using broccoli, put it in the 
            <br>oven five minutes after the chicken.</li>
        <li>Once the chicken is done, remove it from the oven and let it rest
            <br>for a few minutes before shredding it with two forks.</li>
        <li>Serve the shredded chicken over the cooked rice. Squeeze the juice
            <br>of the remaining lime over the top for added freshness. Enjoy!</li>
